				<p> Water as the driving source for all life, is hardly ever appreciated for its amazing work. It forged life, as humans eveloved from single cell organisims that came forth. It sustains us as, about  60% of our physical composition is water based, requiring constant rehydration. It then also propels us, as we search for life on other planets, identyfing the presence of water as its hallmark.

				However, theres more.
				Did you know that 71% of Earth's surface is water. Or how about that 95% of Earth's composition is actually made of water. That there is the same amount of water that is on Earth today that was here on Earth when it formed. That Water traps most of our Carbon Dioxide emmisions. Water also regulates the Earth Tempreture. That water is 9% larger when frozen. Or how about that 97% of Earth's water is Salt water. That 2% of Earth's Fresh water is actually frozen in ice caps. And that the remaining 1% is shared with the rest of humanity. That 80% of illneses in developing countries is water related.
